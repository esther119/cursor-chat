# Create a new Vite project (2025-09-15 22:18Z)

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has typed "npm create vite@latest" which is a command to create a new Vite project. They're in the cursor-chat directory which appears to be a project about Cursor chat export tool based on the project structure.

Looking at the project structure, this seems to be a Python-based project with data parsing scripts, chat history, and cleaned data. The user might want to:
1. Create a new Vite project in this directory
2. Create a new frontend for their cursor chat export tool
3. Or they might just be asking about the command itself

Since they just typed the command without any additional context, I should help them understand what this command does and ask for clarification about their intent. I should also check if they want to create a new Vite project in the current directory or in a subdirectory.

Looking at the git status, there are uncommitted changes and untracked files, so they might want to be careful about where they create the new project.</details></think>

I see you've typed the command `npm create vite@latest`. This command creates a new Vite project, which is a fast build tool for modern web development.

Given that you're currently in the `/Users/esther/Code/cursor-chat` directory which contains your Cursor chat export tool project, I want to clarify your intent:

1. **Create a new Vite project in a subdirectory** - This would be cleaner to keep your existing project structure intact
2. **Create a frontend for your cursor-chat tool** - Perhaps you want to build a web interface to display or interact with the chat data?
3. **Create a completely new project elsewhere** - You might want to navigate to a different directory first

If you run this command in the current directory, it will prompt you to:
- Enter a project name (which will create a new folder)
- Select a framework (React, Vue, Vanilla, etc.)
- Choose TypeScript or JavaScript

Would you like me to help you:
- Create a frontend for your cursor-chat data viewer?
- Set up the Vite project in a specific subdirectory?
- Or something else?

Note: You have uncommitted changes in your current git repository, so creating a new project in a subdirectory would be the safest approach.
