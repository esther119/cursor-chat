      "content": "Based on the file you've shared, here's a summary of what you did in this session:\n\n## Main Changes Made\n\n**1. Changed Static Ball Color**\n- Modified the `Ball` class to accept a configurable `fillColor` parameter\n- Set the static ball to pure black (`sk.color(0)`) while keeping the moving ball white\n\n**2. Adjusted Triangle Size**\n- Reduced the main triangle's `side` parameter from 40 to 24 to make it smaller\n\n**3. Added Extra Triangles**\n- Created 4 extra triangles randomly positioned on the right side of the wall\n- Implemented an `extraTriangles` array that gets populated during setup and rendered each frame\n\n**4. Customized Triangle Colors**\n- Updated the `Triangle` class to support configurable fill colors\n- Set extra triangles to light red `{ r: 255, g: 150, b: 150 }` while keeping the main triangle red\n\n**5. Made Extra Triangles Clickable**\n- Added `containsPoint()` method to `Triangle` class for hit-testing\n- Added `clicked` state property to triangles\n- Updated `mousePressed` to detect clicks on extra triangles and toggle their selection (black outline)\n- Prevented ball launching when clicking on triangles\n\n**6. Added Reflected Triangle**\n- Created one additional triangle that mirrors the original triangle's position across the wall's vertical centerline\n- Positioned it at `mirrorX = 2*wall.cx - triangle.cx` with the same y-coordinate and size\n\n## Technical Implementation\n- Used proper TypeScript types and maintained code consistency\n- Handled p5.js color objects and coordinate calculations\n- Implemented geometric hit-testing for triangle interaction\n- Maintained separation between clickable extra triangles and the main triangle\n\nThe session shows a progression from simple visual tweaks to more complex interactive features, ending with 4 total extra triangles (3 random + 1 mirrored) that are all clickable and visually distinct from the main triangle."
