The sight line shows how the eye \"sees\" the virtual object through the mirror."

I've successfully created a reusable function for calculating virtual object positions and updated the OneMirror component to use it. Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## New Utility Function: `virtualObject.ts`\n\nI created a new utility file with these functions:\n\n1. **`calculateVirtualObjectPosition(objectPosition, mirror)`** - The main function that calculates where a virtual object appears when reflected across a mirror\n2. **`calculateMultipleVirtualObjectPositions(objectPositions, mirror)`** - For calculating multiple virtual objects at once\n3. **`mirrorToMirrorLine(mirror)`** - Helper function to convert a Mirror object to the MirrorLine format used by the reflection functions\n\n## Updated OneMirror Component\n\nThe component now:\n- Uses the `calculateVirtualObjectPosition()` function to compute the virtual triangle position\n- Displays both the real triangle and its virtual counterpart\n- Shows the virtual object with a dashed outline and semi-transparency\n- Draws a sight line from the eye to the virtual object\n- Displays coordinate information for both objects\n- Positions the real triangle on the right side (80% width) for better mirror visualization\n\nThe calculation is now cleanly separated into a reusable function that can be used anywhere in your codebase where you need to compute virtual object positions for mirrors. The function handles all the geometric math internally, including:\n- Converting the mirror angle to the proper normal vector\n- Creating the mirror line equation\n- Using the existing reflection utilities to compute the virtual position\n\nYou can now easily calculate virtual objects for any mirror setup by simply calling `calculateVirtualObjectPosition(objectPos, mirror)`!"

The good news is that the `calculateVirtualObjectPosition` function in the virtualObject.ts file is working correctly and is ready to use whenever you want to implement the virtual object visualization.\n\nThe function correctly:\n1. **Calculates the mirror's normal vector** - perpendicular to the mirror surface\n2. **Creates the mirror line equation** - using the normal vector and mirror position\n3. **Reflects the triangle position** - using the existing reflection utilities\n4. **Returns the virtual position** - as a p5.Vector for easy use\n\nSo whenever you're ready to add the virtual object visualization to your OneMirror component, you can simply:\n1. Import the function: `import { calculateVirtualObjectPosition } from \"./components/geometry/virtualObject\";`\n2. Calculate the virtual position: `const virtualPos = calculateVirtualObjectPosition(triangle.center, mirror);`\n3.

The new version directly implements the geometric principle you described: \"same distance on the opposite side along the perpendicular.\"\n\nThe calculation is now:\n- **Faster** (fewer operations)\n- **Clearer** (directly matches the geometric intuition) \n- **Self-contained** (doesn't need the complex `reflectPoint` function)\n\nGreat insight!

Now the implementation is clean and uses your exact approach. Here's what we have now:\n\n## The Updated Implementation\n\n1. **Uses your V2 utility functions**: `sub`, `add`, `dot` for clean vector operations\n2. **Uses your `reflectPointAcrossAngle` function**: Which reflects a point across a line through point `q` at angle `phi`\n3. **Simple and direct**: The `calculateVirtualObjectPosition` function now just:\n   - Converts p5.Vector to V2 format\n   - Calls `reflectPointAcrossAngle` with the object position, mirror position, and mirror angle\n   - Converts the result back to p5.Vector\n\nThe `reflectPointAcrossAngle` function uses the geometric approach:\n- **u** = unit direction vector of the mirror line\n- **d** = vector from mirror point to object  \n- **k** = scalar projection of d onto the mirror line\n- **dPrime** = `2*parallel - d` (the reflection formula)\n\nThis is much cleaner than the previous approaches and uses the standard V2 vector operations that are consistent with your existing codebase. The math is exactly what you specified!"
