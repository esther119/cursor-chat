Now I'll check for any linter issues in that file.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n- I removed the `extraTriangles` array and its creation/usage.\n- Only the original `triangle` and a single `mirrorTriangle` are drawn and interactable.\n- Click handling now toggles only the original triangle (to show ray) and the `mirrorTriangle` highlight.\n\nLet me know if you also want to disable clicking/highlighting on the mirror triangle or change its color."
