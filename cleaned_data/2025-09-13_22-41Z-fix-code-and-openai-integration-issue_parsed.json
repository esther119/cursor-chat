Your script is now fully working and cleaned up. Here's a summary of what we accomplished:\n\n## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**\n\n1. **✅ Fixed OpenAI Usage**: Changed `use_openai=True` to `use_openai=args.use_openai` \n2. **✅ Set OpenAI as Default**: Added `default=True` to the `--use-openai` argument\n3. **✅ Added .env File Loading**: Script now automatically loads your `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`\n4. **✅ Added Debugging**: Temporarily added debug output to identify the issue\n5. **✅ Cleaned Up**: Removed debug output after confirming it works\n\n## 📊 **Results:**\n\nYour script successfully processed **69 sessions** with **100% high confidence** categorization using OpenAI, generating:\n\n- **36.1%** Code Generation (10 sessions, 1311 min)\n- **25.4%** Feature Development (18 sessions, 920 min) \n- **21.3%** Refactoring (17 sessions, 772 min)\n- **8.7%** Meta/Git (5 sessions, 316 min)\n- **4.0%** Debugging (7 sessions, 145 min)\n- **2.4%** Code Review (2 sessions, 87 min)\n- **1.9%** Planning (9 sessions, 69 min)\n- **0.2%** Configuration (1 session, 7 min)\n\n## 🚀 **How to Use:**\n\n```bash\n# Use OpenAI (default behavior)\npython parse_spechistory.py\n\n# Skip OpenAI, use keywords only  \npython parse_spechistory.py --no-openai\n\n# Test without writing files\npython parse_spechistory.py --dry-run\n```\n\nThe timeline data has been saved to `../public/timeline-data.json` and is ready for your visualization!"

Here's how it works:\n\n## 🗄️ **Cache System:**\n\n1. **Cache Location**: `.cache/` directory (you can see this was created when you ran the script)\n2. **Cache Key**: `{filename}.{content_hash}.json` \n   - Example: `2025-09-01_05-37Z-create-file-for-new-types.md.abc123def.json`\n3. **Cache Logic**:\n   - **Before** calling OpenAI: Check if cache file exists → if yes, return cached result\n   - **After** OpenAI call: Save the response to cache file\n\n## 💰 **Why This Matters:**\n\n- **Saves Money**: OpenAI API calls cost money - cache prevents re-calling for same content\n- **Faster**: Cached responses are instant vs. waiting for API\n- **Reliable**: If API is down, cached results still work\n\n## 🔍 **Check Your Cache:**\n\n---\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/cursor-history && ls -la .cache/ | head -10\n```"
