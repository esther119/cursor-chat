Lint is clean.\n\nBenefits:\n- **Simpler API**: `ReflectionRayRunner.drawProgress(sk, start, reflection, eye, virtual?)`.\n- **Extensible**: Easily add more segments or change styles.\n- **Less duplication**: One runner controls distances, tip/back calculation, and arrowhead.\n\nIf you want, we can:\n- Expose dash/gap and colors as constructor options.\n- Move segment stroke colors per-segment too.",
