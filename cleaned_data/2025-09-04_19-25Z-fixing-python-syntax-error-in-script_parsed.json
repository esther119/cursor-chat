Let me examine the problematic line to understand and fix the issue.\n\n---\n\nRead file: undefined\n\n---\n\nI can see the issue! The problem is with the nested string quotes on line 92. You have an f-string that contains double quotes, and inside those double quotes you're trying to use another set of double quotes for the `\"\\n\".join()` part. This creates a syntax error.\n\nHere's the fix - you need to use single quotes for the inner string:\n\n```python:src/export.py\n// ... existing code ...\nuser_text.append(f\"[selections]  \\n{'\\n'.join([s['text'] for s in bubble['selections']])}\")\n// ... existing code ...\n```\n\nThe issue is that Python can't parse the nested double quotes properly. By changing the inner quotes to single quotes (`'\\n'.join()` and `s['text']`), the syntax will be correct."
