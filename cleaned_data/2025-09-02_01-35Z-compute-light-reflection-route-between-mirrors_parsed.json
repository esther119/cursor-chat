Now I'll open the relevant files in parallel.\n\n---\n\nRead file: /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/src/ray.ts\n\n---\n\nRead file: /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/src/components/objects/Mirror.ts\n\n---\n\nRead file: /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/src/components/animations/ReflectionRayRunner.ts\n\n---\n\nRead file: /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/src/components/objects/Triangle.ts\n\n---\n\nRead file: /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/src/TwoMirrors.tsx\n\n---\n\n---\n\nI'll quickly skim `types.ts` to see available types for returning a multi-bounce path, then propose a small utility function and how to use it in `TwoMirrors.tsx`.\n\n---\n\nRead file: /Users/esther/Code/p5js-typescript/src/types.ts\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### High-level idea (unfolding method)\n- Reflect the target point twice (once across each mirror), then draw one straight line from the source to that twice-reflected target. Where that line crosses the mirrors gives the bounce points.\n- Validate that each bounce hits inside the mirror height and in the correct order (first mirror, then second).\n- Build the path as points: [origin, bounceOnMirrorA, bounceOnMirrorB, target].\n\n### Minimal TypeScript utility\nAdd this to `src/ray.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport type p5 from \"p5\";\nimport { Mirror } from \"./components/objects/Mirror\";\n\nfunction reflectXAcross(x: number, mirrorX: number) {\n  return 2 * mirrorX - x;\n}\n\nfunction withinMirrorY(m: Mirror, y: number): boolean {\n  const halfH = m.h / 2;\n  return y >= m.cy - halfH && y <= m.cy + halfH;\n}\n\n/**\n * Two-bounce path: origin -> mirrorA -> mirrorB -> target.\n * Mirrors are vertical rectangles. Returns [origin, bounceA, bounceB, target] or null if invalid.\n */\nexport function computeTwoBouncePathToTarget(\n  sk: p5,\n  origin: p5.Vector,\n  mirrorA: Mirror,\n  mirrorB: Mirror,\n  target: p5.Vector\n): p5.Vector[] | null {\n  // Unfold target across mirrorB, then across mirrorA\n  const t1x = reflectXAcross(target.x, mirrorB.cx);\n  const t1 = sk.createVector(t1x, target.y);\n  const t2x = reflectXAcross(t1.x, mirrorA.cx);\n  const t2 = sk.createVector(t2x, t1.y);\n\n  const dx = t2.x - origin.x;\n  const dy = t2.y - origin.y;\n  if (Math.abs(dx) < 1e-6) return null; // vertical line cannot cross vertical mirrors\n\n  // Param along the straight line origin -> t2 where x hits each mirror\n  const tAtA = (mirrorA.cx - origin.x) / dx;\n  const tAtB = (mirrorB.cx - origin.x) / dx;\n  if (!(tAtA > 0 && tAtB > 0 && tAtA < tAtB && tAtB < 1)) return null; // correct order and between endpoints\n\n  const yA = origin.y + tAtA * dy;\n  const yB = origin.y + tAtB * dy;\n\n  if (!withinMirrorY(mirrorA, yA) || !withinMirrorY(mirrorB, yB)) return null;\n\n  const bounceA = sk.createVector(mirrorA.cx, yA);\n  const bounceB = sk.createVector(mirrorB.cx, yB);\n\n  return [origin.copy(), bounceA, bounceB, target.copy()];\n}\n\n/**\n * Try both orders (A->B and B->A) and return the first valid path.\n */\nexport function computeAnyTwoBouncePathToTarget(\n  sk: p5,\n  origin: p5.Vector,\n  mirror1: Mirror,\n  mirror2: Mirror,\n  target: p5.Vector\n): p5.Vector[] | null {\n  return (\n    computeTwoBouncePathToTarget(sk, origin, mirror1, mirror2, target) ??\n    computeTwoBouncePathToTarget(sk, origin, mirror2, mirror1, target)\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### How to use in `TwoMirrors.tsx`\n- Origin is the red `triangle` center.\n- Target is `mirror3Triangle` center.\n- Call the helper to get `[A, P1, P2, T]` and feed it to your `PolylineRayRunner`.\n\n```ts\nconst origin = sk.createVector(triangle.cx, triangle.cy);\nconst target = sk.createVector(mirror3Triangle!.cx, mirror3Triangle!.cy);\nconst path = computeAnyTwoBouncePathToTarget(sk, origin, mirror, mirror2, target);\n\nif (path) {\n  angleRayRunner.drawProgress(sk, path); // or use a dedicated runner\n}\n```\n\n- If `path` is null, no valid two-bounce path (misses mirror height, wrong order, or degenerate geometry). You can try swapping mirror order or adjust positions.\n\n- This approach is robust and easy to extend beyond two mirrors by continuing to “unfold” the target across mirrors in reverse bounce order.\n\n- You can also return the bounce points to render markers or for hit testing if needed.\n\n- To constrain to a particular order (e.g., must hit `mirror1` then `mirror2`), use `computeTwoBouncePathToTarget` with that specific order.\n\n- For UI, you can highlight bounce points `(mirrorA.cx, yA)` and `(mirrorB.cx, yB)` to help the player aim.\n\n- If you want to animate as “correct ray,” create a dedicated runner that draws four points instead of three; your existing `PolylineRayRunner` already supports arbitrary polylines.\n\n- This works with your existing vertical `Mirror` representation and `Triangle` center coordinates.\n\n- Edge cases: if the straight line `origin -> t2` is vertical or misses mirror extents, the function returns null.\n\n- Performance: O(1) math; safe to run each frame for preview."

I'll run lints after.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n- I updated the solver: when the straight “unfolded” line is degenerate (e.g., nearly vertical), it now uses an algebraic two-bounce solver and tries both mirror orders. This should eliminate most nulls when a path truly exists.\n\nWhy you were seeing null:\n- A valid path requires both bounce y’s to lie within each mirror’s height and the hits to occur in order. If either bounce lands outside the mirror or the order fails, it returns null.\n\nAbout your angle idea:\n- Using the second-bounce direction derived from angle(eye → mirror3Triangle) is effectively what the algebraic method enforces via reflection constraints. It fixes the between-mirrors segment orientation and ensures the final segment goes through the eye; then it solves for the bounce y’s and validates mirror extents.\n\nWhat to do next:\n- Reload and check; if it’s still null, the current geometry doesn’t allow hitting `mirror3Triangle` via both mirrors (with their heights and positions). Try swapping mirror order or adjusting positions/heights. If you want, I can also add a variant that strictly forces that specific second-bounce angle and reports why it fails when over-constrained.",
