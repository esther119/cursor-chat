For your default positions (400×300 canvas), the initial shot from the triangle to the mirror is about **0.405 radians (~23.2°)** to the right.\n\nIf you want to log it dynamically in `P5Sketch.tsx`, right after you have `startPoint` and `reflectionPoint`:\n```ts\nconst angle = Math.atan2(reflectionPoint.y - startPoint.y, reflectionPoint.x - startPoint.x);\nconsole.log(\"ray angle (rad):\", angle, \"deg:\", sk.degrees(angle));\n```\n\n- Tapped the sketch to see how the ray is built and computed the initial segment angle from `triangle` to the reflection point using atan2.\n- For your current defaults, that works out to ~0.405 rad (~23.2°)."
