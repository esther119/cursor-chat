only show the x and y for the object position

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the console.log statement to only show the x and y coordinates of the object position. Let me first read the current file to understand the context.

Read file: undefined

Now I'll update the console.log statement on line 32 to only show the x and y coordinates of the object position:

```typescript:src/components/geometry/virtualObject.ts
// ... existing code ...
  console.log("objectPosition", { x: objectPosition.x, y: objectPosition.y }, "mirror", mirror);
// ... existing code ...
```

This change will make the console output cleaner by only showing the x and y coordinates of the object position instead of the entire p5.Vector object, which includes additional properties and methods.
