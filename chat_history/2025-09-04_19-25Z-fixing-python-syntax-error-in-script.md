I can see there's a syntax error in the Python file. Let me examine the problematic line to understand and fix the issue.

Read file: undefined

I can see the issue! The problem is with the nested string quotes on line 92. You have an f-string that contains double quotes, and inside those double quotes you're trying to use another set of double quotes for the `"\n".join()` part. This creates a syntax error.

Here's the fix - you need to use single quotes for the inner string:

```python:src/export.py
// ... existing code ...
user_text.append(f"[selections]  \n{'\n'.join([s['text'] for s in bubble['selections']])}")
// ... existing code ...
```

The issue is that Python can't parse the nested double quotes properly. By changing the inner quotes to single quotes (`'\n'.join()` and `s['text']`), the syntax will be correct.
