# Refactor code for mirror triangles (2025-09-02 01:32Z)

_**User (2025-09-01 22:51Z)**_

 now I'm create many mirror triangle, any way to refactor the code?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning refactor steps**

I'm planning a multi-step refactor and want to create a to-do list. First, I need to audit duplication and find shared logic between `SingleMirror.tsx` and `TwoMirrors.tsx`. Next, I’ll create a reusable `MirrorScene` component for handling mirror triangles. After that, I’ll refactor the existing components to use this new component. I'll also update types in `types.ts` as needed, ensure RayController integrates with the new scene, and finally test and fix any linter errors. I'll use todo_write to track progress.</details></think>

I'll scan the current components to spot duplication between `SingleMirror.tsx`, `TwoMirrors.tsx`, `Mirror.ts`, `Triangle.ts`, `RayController.ts`, `ray.ts`, `types.ts`, and `App.tsx` so I can propose a clean abstraction for multiple mirror triangles.

## Todo List

- [-] Audit SingleMirror and TwoMirrors for shared logic
- [ ] Create reusable MirrorScene to support N mirror triangles
- [ ] Refactor SingleMirror and TwoMirrors to use MirrorScene
- [ ] Add/update types to support mirror scene config
- [ ] Validate RayController integration and behavior unchanged

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refactoring code for triangles**

I need to refactor the code to support multiple mirror triangles as the user requested. The developer guidance suggests that I operate as an agent, making edits using tools, and only output code if specifically asked. Since the user wants suggestions for the refactor, I’ll propose changes while implementing them. First, I’ll scan the relevant files for duplication and identify where to refactor by using a parallel read of various files. I'll keep updating the status as I go.</details></think>

---

I'll review `SingleMirror.tsx`, `TwoMirrors.tsx`, `components/objects/Mirror.ts`, `Triangle.ts`, `RayController.ts`, `ray.ts`, `types.ts`, and `App.tsx` to identify duplicated patterns and define a common scene abstraction.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning code refactoring**

The user asked about the possibility of refactoring the code. I think we could implement a reusable component like `MirrorScene.tsx` or `MultiMirror.tsx` that takes arrays to reduce duplication. I’ll refactor `SingleMirror` and `TwoMirrors` to utilize `MirrorScene`, while updating types in `types.ts` and `App.tsx` too. It's important to avoid being overly verbose but still provide status updates using the todo tool. After implementing changes, I’ll make sure to check for linter errors. The next step involves enabling `MirrorScene` to support multiple mirrors and optional triangles.
**Designing MirrorScene component**

I'm planning to design the `MirrorScene` component to accept specific properties: an array of `MirrorSpec`, which includes parameters like `cx`, `cy`, `w`, `h`, and an optional `color`; and an array of `TriangleSpec` with parameters like `cx`, `cy`, and optional `fill`. I’ll also consider an eye position and a boolean for `showRayController`. In the existing code, the `RayController` is anchored to the main triangle, and I need to ensure the base angle calculations are accurate for each mirror. I'll think about how to compute these angles relative to a chosen reference mirror.
**Implementing MirrorScene functionalities**

The code utilizes `getMarkerIndexForAngle(baseAngle, angle)` to map additional mirrors to marker indices, which allows scaling to N mirrors. The `MirrorScene` will manage the p5 lifecycle and accept configurations for `mirrors`, `triangles`, and `eye`. I’ll implement an "activeTriangleIndex" that defaults to 0, allowing the ray controller to function accordingly. When drawing triangles, I need to consider the concept of mirrored triangles and how to efficiently calculate their mirrored counterparts across the vertical centerline, which includes handling reflections through sequences of mirrors.
**Generating mirrored triangles**

This reflects the previous mirrored triangle through the first mirror, not the third. For a general solution, it seems tricky, especially since the user wants to create multiple mirrored triangles. I could implement a helper function that takes a list of vertical mirror center x positions and generates mirrored triangles by reflecting the base triangle across each mirror sequentially. Their existing code shows three triangles: the original, one mirrored across the first mirror, and another mirrored across the second, creating a chain of reflections. This could potentially help to create symmetrical illusions.
**Refactoring code structure**

I'm thinking about how to simplify the refactoring process. We can create a helper function `createMirroredTriangles`, which generates mirrored triangles from a base triangle and a list of mirrors. I'll also need to ensure that we export useful functions, like `getReflectedXAcrossMirror`, from `ray.ts`, currently internal. 

Then, for the `MirrorScene`, which I'll implement, it should handle parameters like width, height, and eye position. I'll also modify `SingleMirror` and `</details></think>
