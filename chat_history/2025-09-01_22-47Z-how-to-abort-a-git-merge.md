_**Assistant**_

To abort a git merge, you need to use:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

This will cancel the merge operation and return your repository to the state it was in before you started the merge. All the merge conflicts will be discarded and you'll be back to your original branch state.

The command you tried (`git abort`) isn't a valid git command - you need the full `git merge --abort` command.
