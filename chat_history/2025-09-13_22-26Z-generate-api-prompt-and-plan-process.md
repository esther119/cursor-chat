_**User (USER)**_

I realize the catetory and title isn't right. so I should write a system prompt to for a open ai api and output te 

- category, 
- title
- preview 

create an md to plan out this process

I'll create a concise markdown plan in `cursor-history/openai-categorization-plan.md` with a concrete system prompt, output contract, and implementation steps, then add it to the repo.

- I created `cursor-history/openai-categorization-plan.md` with a concrete system prompt, templates, examples, validation rules, and implementation steps.

- Additions include:
  - A strict system prompt for deriving exactly category, title, preview.
  - Allowed category set and definitions.
  - User message template.
  - Output contract, examples, validation and edge cases.
  - Steps to integrate into `parse_spechistory.py` behind a `--use-openai` flag, plus caching and QA.
