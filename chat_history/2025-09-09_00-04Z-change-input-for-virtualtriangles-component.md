change the input of virtualTriangles to the selected virtualTriangles from @OneMirror.tsx

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to change the `animateRay` function to accept the selected virtual triangle from OneMirror.tsx, instead of passing an array.

Looking at the current code:
- In OneMirror.tsx at line 202, it's passing: `virtualTriangles: [virtualTriangles[selectedTriangleIndex]]`
- This is already passing just the selected virtual triangle wrapped in an array

Let me check the animateRay function to see how it's using virtualTriangles:

From the manually_added_selection, I can see it's at line 23 of animateRay.ts. Let me read that file to understand the current implementation.</details></think>

I'll help you update the `animateRay` function to accept the selected virtual triangle directly instead of an array. Let me first check the current implementation of the `animateRay` function.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the `animateRay` function, I can see that:

1. It accepts `virtualTriangles` as an array parameter (line 15)
2. There's a bug in line 54-55 where it checks for `virtualTriangles[1]` but then uses `virtualTriangles[5]` - this seems incorrect
3. The function should be using the selected virtual triangle, not hardcoded indices

I need to:
1. Change the parameter from `virtualTriangles: Triangle[]` to `selectedVirtualTriangle: Triangle | null`
2. Update the logic to use the selected virtual triangle
3. Update the call site in OneMirror.tsx

Let me make these changes:</details></think>

Now I'll update the `animateRay` function to accept a single selected virtual triangle instead of an array:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The changes have been made successfully. Let me summarize what was changed:

1. Updated the `AnimateRayParams` interface to accept `selectedVirtualTriangle: Triangle` instead of `virtualTriangles: Triangle[]`
2. Updated the `animateRay` function parameter to match the interface change
3. Fixed the logic that was using hardcoded array indices to use the selected virtual triangle directly
4. Updated the call site in OneMirror.tsx to pass the selected virtual triangle directly instead of wrapping it in an array

The code is now cleaner and more explicit about what it expects - a single selected virtual triangle rather than an array.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully updated the `animateRay` function to accept the selected virtual triangle directly instead of an array. Here's what I changed:

1. **Updated the interface** in `animateRay.ts`:
   - Changed `virtualTriangles: Triangle[]` to `selectedVirtualTriangle: Triangle`

2. **Fixed the function parameter** in the `animateRay` function to match the new interface

3. **Simplified the logic** that uses the virtual triangle:
   - Removed the buggy conditional check for `virtualTriangles[1]` and the incorrect usage of `virtualTriangles[5]`
   - Now directly uses `selectedVirtualTriangle.center.copy()` to add the endpoint

4. **Updated the call site** in `OneMirror.tsx`:
   - Changed from `virtualTriangles: [virtualTriangles[selectedTriangleIndex]]` to `selectedVirtualTriangle: virtualTriangles[selectedTriangleIndex]`

The code is now cleaner and more explicit about its intention - it expects a single selected virtual triangle rather than an array. The animation will now correctly use the selected virtual triangle as the endpoint for the ray path.
