Based on the file you've shared, here's a summary of what you did in this session:

## Main Changes Made

**1. Changed Static Ball Color**
- Modified the `Ball` class to accept a configurable `fillColor` parameter
- Set the static ball to pure black (`sk.color(0)`) while keeping the moving ball white

**2. Adjusted Triangle Size**
- Reduced the main triangle's `side` parameter from 40 to 24 to make it smaller

**3. Added Extra Triangles**
- Created 4 extra triangles randomly positioned on the right side of the wall
- Implemented an `extraTriangles` array that gets populated during setup and rendered each frame

**4. Customized Triangle Colors**
- Updated the `Triangle` class to support configurable fill colors
- Set extra triangles to light red `{ r: 255, g: 150, b: 150 }` while keeping the main triangle red

**5. Made Extra Triangles Clickable**
- Added `containsPoint()` method to `Triangle` class for hit-testing
- Added `clicked` state property to triangles
- Updated `mousePressed` to detect clicks on extra triangles and toggle their selection (black outline)
- Prevented ball launching when clicking on triangles

**6. Added Reflected Triangle**
- Created one additional triangle that mirrors the original triangle's position across the wall's vertical centerline
- Positioned it at `mirrorX = 2*wall.cx - triangle.cx` with the same y-coordinate and size

## Technical Implementation
- Used proper TypeScript types and maintained code consistency
- Handled p5.js color objects and coordinate calculations
- Implemented geometric hit-testing for triangle interaction
- Maintained separation between clickable extra triangles and the main triangle

The session shows a progression from simple visual tweaks to more complex interactive features, ending with 4 total extra triangles (3 random + 1 mirrored) that are all clickable and visually distinct from the main triangle.

# Interactive Triangle System with Color Customization

Added clickable extra triangles with visual feedback, customized ball and triangle colors, and implemented geometric reflection across a wall centerline while maintaining hit-testing and selection states.
