I can see from the selected code that you already have a `Mirror` class with a constructor that takes a position vector. Let me show you how to construct a mirror object:

```typescript
// Create a mirror at position (100, 200)
const mirrorPosition = new p5.Vector(100, 200);
const mirror = new Mirror(mirrorPosition);

// Or with a custom color
const customColor = { r: 255, g: 100, b: 100 }; // Red mirror
const coloredMirror = new Mirror(mirrorPosition, customColor);

// Or create position vector inline
const mirror2 = new Mirror(new p5.Vector(300, 150));
```

The `Mirror` constructor takes:
1. **Required**: `pos` - a `p5.Vector` with x and y coordinates for the mirror's center position
2. **Optional**: `color` - an object with r, g, b values (defaults to light blue: `{ r: 144, g: 213, b: 255 }`)

The mirror will be created with:
- Width: 10 pixels
- Height: 180 pixels  
- Rounded corners (radius 4)
- Center positioned at the given vector coordinates

Is this what you were looking for, or did you need help with something specific about using the Mirror class?
