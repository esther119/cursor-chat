_**Assistant**_



---

I'll start by adding a structured todo list for the multi-step implementation, then scan key files to understand integration points, create the Python parser to generate `public/timeline-data.json`, run it, and build the React timeline component plus styles and integrate it into `src/App.tsx`.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Create Python parser parse_spechistory.py to emit timeline-data.json
- [ ] Run parser to generate public/timeline-data.json
- [ ] Add types for Timeline data in src/types.ts
- [ ] Build Timeline React component with segments, legend, stats
- [ ] Style Timeline with CSS and hover tooltips
- [ ] Integrate Timeline into App.tsx and load JSON
- [ ] Run lints and fix issues

---



---

I'll scan the current parser file and key React files to understand where to integrate the timeline, then implement the Python parser and React component accordingly.

I'll create the Python parser, Timeline component and CSS, update types, and integrate the component into `App.tsx`, then run the parser and lint the changed files.

I'm going to check the project's package.json to confirm dependencies like react and p5 are present, which would resolve the linter's missing module errors.

---

---

I'll add missing type declarations for CSS/SVG imports and switch to a type-only import for p5. Then I'll run a build to verify everything compiles.

---



---



---



---



---

I'll check tsconfig to ensure JSX settings and type resolution are correct for React 19, which should resolve 'react/jsx-runtime' and JSX intrinsic types errors.

I'll run a build to verify the new Timeline component and parser integration compile cleanly and to surface any real TypeScript errors before finalizing.

---

```bash
npm run build | cat
```

```
workspace $ npm run build | cat

> p5js-typescript@0.0.0 build
> tsc -b && vite build

sh: 1: tsc: not found
workspace $
```

---



---

I'll install dependencies and run the build to ensure the new Timeline component compiles and the project is healthy.

---

```bash
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build | cat
```

```

- I created the Python parser `parse_spechistory.py`, generated `public/timeline-data.json`, added timeline types in `src/types.ts`, built `src/components/Timeline.tsx` with `Timeline.css`, integrated it into `src/App.tsx`, and ran a successful production build.

- To view it, start the dev server and open the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

- The timeline loads from `public/timeline-data.json`, shows proportional segments with category colors, hover tooltips, and legend/stats.
