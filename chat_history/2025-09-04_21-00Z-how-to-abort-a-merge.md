how to abort merge

---

_**Assistant**_

To abort a merge in Git, you can use:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

This command will cancel the current merge operation and return your repository to the state it was in before the merge began. It's useful when you encounter merge conflicts that you don't want to resolve right now, or if you realize you started the wrong merge.

**When to use `git merge --abort`:**
- You're in the middle of a merge with conflicts
- You want to cancel the merge and try a different approach
- You accidentally started merging the wrong branch

**Note:** This command only works if you're currently in the middle of a merge. If the merge has already completed (successfully or unsuccessfully), you would need to use other commands like `git reset` or `git revert` instead.

From your terminal output, it looks like you might have typed `git abort` instead of `git merge --abort`, which is why you got the error message saying "'abort' is not a git command."
