<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining git commit deletion**

I need to answer the user about how to delete the latest commit they haven't pushed. I think I can provide minimal commands rather than calling any tools since this is a general Git question. The main commands I'll share are: `git reset --soft HEAD1` to keep changes staged, `git reset --mixed HEAD1` to keep them unstaged, and `git reset --hard HEAD1` to discard changes. I’ll also emphasize verifying with `git log origin/main..HEAD` to ensure it's not pushed, which is essential!
**Providing git commands for commits**

The user's terminal indicates they are ahead of origin/main by a commit, which means their changes are local. I’ll provide commands for deleting the latest commit and also explain how to restore it if they make a mistake.

- **Delete the latest commit**:
    ```bash
    git reset --soft HEAD1  # Keep changes staged
    git reset --mixed HEAD1  # Keep changes unstaged
    git reset --hard HEAD1  # Discard changes
    ```

- **Restore a deleted commit**:
    ```bash
    git reflog  # Find the commit hash
    git reset --hard <hash>  # Restore the specific commit
    ```

It’s good to note that they’re using macOS zsh, and we should keep our response succinct while avoiding heavy formatting.
**Crafting git commands**

I need to provide helpful commands to the user while keeping things straightforward. Since their query is basic, I can skip a summary of changes or impacts at the end.

First, to verify that their local commits haven't been pushed, I’ll suggest this command:

```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD  # Show remote differences
```

If they find one commit present and it’s safe to proceed, they can go ahead without any tool-related status update, as we’re not using any tools here.
**Providing git reset commands**

I want to share useful commands for the user regarding their latest commit situation:

1. **Keep your changes staged**:
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD1
   ```

2. **Keep changes but unstaged**:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD1
   ```

3. **Discard changes completely**:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD1
   ```

If the user renamed their branch, they'll need to refer to it as `origin/your-branch`. If they've already pushed the commit, they can use a revert instead of a reset. I should confirm whether they want to keep any changes before moving forward!</details></think>

### Delete your latest local commit (not pushed)

Pick one option depending on whether you want to keep the changes:

- **Keep changes staged**
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- **Keep changes but unstaged (default)**
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

- **Discard the commit and its changes**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Optional safety check (confirm it isn’t pushed yet; replace `main` if needed):
```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
```

If you change your mind, you can recover via:
```bash
git reflog
git reset --hard <commit_hash_before_reset>
```
