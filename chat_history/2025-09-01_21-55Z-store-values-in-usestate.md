<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Looking into state management**

I need to incorporate `useState` to store startPoint, reflectionPoint, endPoint, and virtualEnd in P5Sketch.tsx. The user wants all these values stored in `useState`. First, I’ll scan the file to understand the current code context. I should follow the tool use protocol, providing a brief status update before making any calls. I'll read the whole file since it's only 182 lines — that should be safe. Once I do that, I can implement `useState` with the proper types.
**Planning code changes**

It seems like the toolset doesn’t have a write capability, but in the Cursor environment, I can demonstrate code changes using code blocks with citations. I should provide relevant snippets with line numbers and file paths, but I can also present the entire file if needed. The spec allows me to truncate code while suggesting my edits. Since I can't write the file directly, I'll propose the changes for the user to apply. I need to read the file first to locate where to insert `useState` and maybe update type imports. I'll consider adding an interface for points too.
**Opening file for inspection**

I need to inspect the `ray.ts` file, but I'm thinking that the points might be of type `p5.Vector` or possibly a custom vector type. To clarify this, I should open the `P5Sketch.tsx` file. By reviewing that, I can better understand how these points are currently structured and whether I'll need to implement a custom interface or continue with the existing types. Let’s dive into that file!</details></think>

I'll open `src/P5Sketch.tsx` to see how `startPoint`, `reflectionPoint`, `endPoint`, and `virtualEnd` are currently computed so I can add state for them in the right place and with correct types.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing state management**

I need to store values like startPoint, reflectionPoint, endPoint, and virtualEnd in `useState`. The current file is a function component using `useEffect` to draw with p5. I'll likely use p5.Vector for these values. However, updating React state from within the p5 draw loop may lead to frequent re-renders. The user wants just to store these values minimally. So, I'll implement `useState` at the top and remember to import `useState` from React along with p5.Vector.
**Optimizing state updates**

I can reference the p5.Vector type for typing state since it's available through the imported default 'p5'. Inside the draw function, when I compute `reflectionRayResult`, my plan is to use `setRayPoints(...)`. However, setting state every frame might be too heavy. The user's request is to store these values, likely meaning to update them only once computed within that block. I'll update to nulls if no valid results exist while limiting updates by only changing state when necessary. I wonder if I should set the state only when toggling `showDirectRay` to true?
**Clarifying state usage**

So, I've noticed that the user commented out the `if (showDirectRay)` to always compute and draw the reflection ray every frame. This makes me think they want to store these points for later use, but since the user specifically asked for `useState`, I should stick to that instead of using `useRef`. 

I can set the state only in `mousePressed` when the dot is clicked, triggering `showDirectRay` to true. I might update the state during the animation as needed, interpreting the user's instructions with minimal assumptions.
**Reducing re-renders**

To minimize re-render frequency, I can throttle the updates using a ref to check the last values through numeric equality. However, since vector objects differ, an alternative could be to store plain objects like {x, y} for each point. This way, I can shallow compare numeric values and update only if they change significantly. But there’s the issue of the eye and triangle moving when animating. 

Also, I remember to provide a micro status update before tool calls, similar to what I did earlier before calling `read_file`.
**Modifying code for state management**

I need to modify the code to implement state management with `useState` for storing ray points. Since we don't have a tool to write files, I'll use the quoting format for code edits. First, I’ll import `useState` at the top of the file. Then, I’ll define the state for ray points as follows:

```typescript
const [rayPoints, setRayPoints] = useState<{ startPoint: p5.Vector; reflectionPoint: p5.Vector; endPoint: p5.Vector; virtualEnd: p5.Vector } | null>(null);
```

Next, I'll call `setRayPoints` inside `draw` after computing the points and handle cases when the reflection result is falsy by setting the state to null:

```typescript
} else {
  setRayPoints(null);
}
```

Finally, I'll ensure proper indentation and provide the modified lines with their locations.</details></think>

---

I'll add React state in `src/P5Sketch.tsx` to store `startPoint`, `reflectionPoint`, `endPoint`, and `virtualEnd`, and update it inside `draw()` when these are computed.

```1:1:src/P5Sketch.tsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
```

```24:24:src/P5Sketch.tsx
  const [rayPoints, setRayPoints] = useState<{
    startPoint: p5.Vector;
    reflectionPoint: p5.Vector;
    endPoint: p5.Vector;
    virtualEnd: p5.Vector;
  } | null>(null);
```

```117:125:src/P5Sketch.tsx
          const virtualEnd = sk.createVector(virtualX, startPoint.y);
          setRayPoints({ startPoint, reflectionPoint, endPoint, virtualEnd });
          reflectionRayRunner.drawProgress(
            sk,
            startPoint,
            reflectionPoint,
            endPoint,
            virtualEnd
          );
        } else {
          setRayPoints(null);
        }
```

- You can now consume `rayPoints` anywhere in the component; it will be `null` when the reflection path isn’t available.

- We added `useState` to the import, defined `rayPoints` state, and update it on each frame where the values are computed.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing useState in P5Sketch**

I need to implement `useState` for storing several points in `P5Sketch.tsx`. This means I'll modify the actual file since they asked for implementation. Based on the developer tool flow, I'll use `todo_write` for these changes, but it seems straightforward — just one or two edits without needing a todo list. I'll make a micro status update and then perform the necessary read/edit. First, I'll update the import line for `useState` and then define the state for the points at the correct location.
**Adding state in TypeScript**

I see that the file has `containerRef` and `p5InstanceRef` defined, and I need to add a state variable after them. Since I'm working in TypeScript, I'm making sure that the `p5` type is accessible and that `p5.Vector` is correctly typed.

In the `draw` function, I'll handle the `reflectionRayResult` so that when it exists, I compute `virtualEnd` and update `rayPoints`. If there's no result, I'll set `rayPoints` to `null`. I need to be cautious not to trigger extra re-renders due to the frequent `setState` in `draw`, which runs at 60 fps. I know the user prefers `useState`, so I’ll stick with that, but I might consider throttling for performance.
**Implementing setRayPoints**

The task is to implement storing values, specifically using `setRayPoints` for each frame. While they might want to consume these values, the focus is on storage. It could be beneficial to call `setRayPoints` only if the values change, but checking equality for `p5.Vector` objects is complex, so I'll skip that for now.

I’ll make sure to maintain proper formatting with two-space indentation. After editing the code, I’ll run `read_lints` to catch any linter errors and apply changes using `apply_patch`. I won't share the code with the user directly, but I might provide a summary.
**Preparing patch changes**

I’m getting ready to implement some changes. First, I’ll modify the import line to include `useState`. This means changing the line from `import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";` to `import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";`.

Next, I’ll add the state declaration for `rayPoints` right after `p5InstanceRef`, which is around line 24. There’s a blank line at that point, so I’ll replace it with the new state line. In the `draw` function, I’ll call `setRayPoints(...)` after creating `virtualEnd`, just before `reflectionRayRunner.drawProgress`.
**Adding else and handling state**

I need to include an else branch for when `reflectionRayResult` is falsy, which currently does nothing. I'll add `setRayPoints(null)` in this else block right after line 125. 

Now, I must keep in mind the ESLint rules. Since we define `rayPoints` but don’t use it, we might hit a linter error. To handle this, I could just declare the setter from `useState`, like `const [, setRayPoints] = useState<...>(null);`. This way, I avoid the unused variable error but still align with the user's request to store values. 

After implementing, I’ll run `read_lints` on `P5Sketch.tsx` to check for errors.</details></think>

---

I'll update `src/P5Sketch.tsx` to add a `useState` that stores `startPoint`, `reflectionPoint`, `endPoint`, and `virtualEnd`, and set it each frame when those values are computed, while avoiding unused-variable lints by only keeping the setter. Then I'll check for linter errors in the updated file.

---



---

I added state to `src/P5Sketch.tsx` and set it inside the draw loop. Now I'll check for linter issues in that file.

- I added `useState` to `src/P5Sketch.tsx` and now store `startPoint`, `reflectionPoint`, `endPoint`, and `virtualEnd` each frame when available, or `null` otherwise. No lints found.

set default not as null but as (80,120), (200, 152.72), (100, 180), (320, 120) as vector

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the `useState` default value to use the specified coordinates as p5.Vector objects instead of null.

Perfect! I've updated the `useState` default value to use the specified coordinates as p5.Vector objects:
- `startPoint`: (80, 120)
- `reflectionPoint`: (200, 152.72) 
- `endPoint`: (100, 180)
- `virtualEnd`: (320, 120)

The state will now initialize with these default vector values instead of null.
